This file is a trial for using the git version controller
I used git init to initialise the folder as a git repository
>git init
>git status was used to looksie inside the git files being held = none
>git add file.txt 
>git status shows new file file.txt
>git commit -m "comment"
>git log shows user and email of github repo and what was commited with comment
And now I am trying to change this file
